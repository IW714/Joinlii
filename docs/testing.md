## Testing Environment Setup

- Ensure that both the frontend and backend are running.
- Use test databases or mock data to avoid affecting production data.
- Install necessary testing libraries and frameworks (e.g., Jest, React Testing Library).

## Unit Testing

- **Frontend**:
  - Test components in isolation using Jest and React Testing Library.
  - Ensure that components render correctly with various props.
  - Test form validations and state changes.

- **Backend**:
  - Test individual functions and controllers.
  - Mock database interactions using tools like `jest-mock`.

## Integration Testing

- Test the interaction between frontend components and backend APIs.
- Use tools like `axios-mock-adapter` to mock API responses.
- Ensure that the frontend handles API responses correctly.

## End-to-End Testing

- Use tools like Cypress or Selenium to perform end-to-end tests.
- Simulate user interactions like registration, login, navigation, and logout.
- Test protected routes to ensure unauthorized access is prevented.

## Testing Authentication Flow

- **Registration**:
  - Test successful registration with valid inputs.
  - Test error handling with invalid inputs or existing email.

- **Login**:
  - Test login with correct and incorrect credentials.
  - Verify that authentication state updates correctly.

- **Protected Routes**:
  - Ensure that authenticated users can access protected pages.
  - Verify that unauthenticated users are redirected to the login page.

- **Logout**:
  - Test that logout clears authentication state.
  - Confirm that the user cannot access protected routes after logout.

## Useful Tools

- **Jest**: JavaScript testing framework.
- **React Testing Library**: For testing React components.
- **Cypress**: End-to-end testing framework.
- **Postman**: For testing API endpoints manually.

## Best Practices

- Write tests alongside your code to ensure coverage.
- Use descriptive test cases and assertions.
- Mock external dependencies to isolate the code under test.
- Run tests frequently during development.
